This model implements the iaf_sfa_rr aspects of iaf_cond_exp_sfa_rr in
nest, that is contrary to the nest model, it does not include the "cond_exp" synapse model,

This model was used in:

Name: iaf_cond_exp_sfa_rr - Simple conductance based leaky integrate-and-fire neuron model.

Description:
iaf_cond_exp_sfa_rr is an iaf_cond_exp_sfa_rr i.e. an implementation of a
spiking neuron using IAF dynamics with conductance-based synapses,
with additional spike-frequency adaptation and relative refractory
mechanisms as described in Dayan+Abbott, 2001, page 166.

As for the iaf_cond_exp_sfa_rr, Incoming spike events induce a post-synaptic
change  of  conductance  modelled  by an  exponential  function.  The
exponential function is  normalised such that an event  of weight 1.0
results in a peak current of 1 nS.

Outgoing spike events induce a change of the adaptation and relative
refractory conductances by q_sfa and q_rr, respectively.  Otherwise
these conductances decay exponentially with time constants tau_sfa
and tau_rr, respectively.

Parameters:
The following parameters can be set in the status dictionary.

V        double - Membrane potential in mV
E_L        double - Leak reversal potential in mV.
C_m        double - Capacity of the membrane in pF
t_ref      double - Duration of refractory period in ms.
V_th       double - Spike threshold in mV.
V_reset    double - Reset potential of the membrane in mV.
E_ex       double - Excitatory reversal potential in mV.
E_in       double - Inhibitory reversal potential in mV.
g_L        double - Leak conductance in nS;
tau_ex     double - Time constant of the excitatory synaptic exponential function in ms.
tau_in     double - Time constant of the inhibitory synaptic exponential function in ms.
q_sfa      double - Outgoing spike activated quantal spike-frequency adaptation conductance increase in nS.
q_rr       double - Outgoing spike activated quantal relative refractory conductance increase in nS.
tau_sfa    double - Time constant of spike-frequency adaptation in ms.
tau_rr     double - Time constant of the relative refractory mechanism in ms.
E_sfa      double - spike-frequency adaptation conductance reversal potential in mV.
E_rr       double - relative refractory mechanism conductance reversal potential in mV.
I_e        double - an external stimulus current in pA.
