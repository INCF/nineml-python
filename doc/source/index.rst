=====================
NineML Python library
=====================

NineML_ is a language for describing the dynamics and connectivity of neuronal
network simulations; in particular for large-scale simulations of many point
neurons.

The language is defined as an object model, described in the
`NineML specification`_, with standardized serializations to XML, JSON, YAML
and HDF5.

This documentation describes the :py:mod:`nineml` Python package, which
implements the NineML_ object model using Python classes, allowing models to be
created, edited, introspected, etc. using Python, and then written to/read from
the NineML_ XML format.
