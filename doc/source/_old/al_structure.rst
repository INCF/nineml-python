The Building Blocks of the NineML Abstraction Layer
===================================================

A NineML component can be considered in 2 parts: the internal *dynamics* and
the external *interface*.

Dynamics
--------

The dynamics are the *internal* mechanisms governing the behaviour of the
component. The dynamics of a component are specified in terms of the following:

* StateVariables
* Regimes
* Transitions
* Aliases
* Events


StateVariables & Regime Graphs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The dynamics of a component is defined by a set of *state-variables*; variables
that can change either continuously or discontinuously as a function of time.
The changes to state variables happen in two ways:
    * through ``TimeDerivatives``  , which define the state variables
      evolution over time, for example :math:`dX/dt=1-X`

    * through ``StateAssignments``, which make discrete changes to a
      StateVariable's value, for example :math:`X = X + 1`
      

A component contains a `Regime-graph`; a graph consisting of `Regimes` at the
vertices, and `Transitions` at the edges. At any given time, a component will be
in a single `Regime`. A regime contains a set of TimeDerivatives, one for each
StateVariable of the component, which define how the StateVariables evolve over
time. 


This diagram shows the dynamics block for an imaginary component.

This dynamics has 3 state variables, *X,Y & Z*, and a state graph with 3
regimes, *regime1*, *regime2* & *regime3*. At any time, a component will be in
one of these regimes, and the state variables will evolve accordingly. 



Components can move between Regimes via transitions. There are 2 ways of
triggering a transition:

* By a condition of the state variables, for example :math:`X>Y`.
* By an `InputEvent` on a port. 

When a transition is triggered; three things can happen:

* The component can change regime. For example, in the example above, if the
  component is in *regime3*, and the trigger for *t3* is satisfied, then the
  component will move into *regime1*.

* `StateAssignments` can take place, for example, :math:`X=0`
* The component can send `OutputEvents` 

During a transition, multiple StateAssignments and `OutputEvents` can occur.


.. note::
    * The Regime-graph for a component must not contain an islands - regimes
      which can not be reached from each other.
    * If a TimeDerivative for a state variable is not defined in a regime, it
      is assumed to be zero.
    * A Transition does not need to lead to a change of regime. It can cause
      StateAssignments and OutputEvents, and leave the component in the
      original regime. (For example *t5* in the diagram)


Aliases
~~~~~~~


Aliases are motivated from two problems;

* Rather than writing long expressions for functions of state-variables, we can
  define an alias once. 
  For example, we can define chains of aliases::
    
    m_alpha = (alphaA + alphaB*V) / ( alphaC + exp((alphaD+V/alphaE)) )
    m_beta =  (betaA + betaB*V) / ( betaC + exp((betaD+V/betaE)) )
    minf = m_alpha / (m_alpha + m_beta)
    mtau = 1./(m_alpha+m_beta)
    dm/dt = (1/C) * (minf-m)/mtau

  In this case, *m_alpha*, *m_beta*, *minf* and *mtau* are all alias
  definitions. There is no reason we couldn't expand our :math:`dm/dt`
  description out to eliminate the these intermediate aliases, but the
  expression would be very long and difficult to read.

* If we would like to communicate a value other than a simple state variable to
  to another component. For example, if we have a component representing a
  neuron, which has an internal StateVariable, 'V', we may be interested in
  transmitting a current, for example :math:`i=g*(E-V)`

.. note:: 
    
    Aliases are defined in the Dynamics, *not* in the Regime. This means that
    aliases are the same across all regimes.


Events
~~~~~~

As well as being able to communicate continuous values, components are also
able to emit and receive `Event` s. Events are discrete notifications that are
transmitted over EventPorts.  Since EventPorts have names, saying
that we transmit a 'event1' for example would mean transmitting an event on
the EventPort called 'event1'. Events can be used to signal action
potentials firing for example. 



Interface
---------
The interface is the *external* view of the component; what inputs and outputs
the component exposes to other components and the parameters that can be set
for the component.

The interface consists of *Ports* and *Parameters*.


Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~
Parameters allow us to define the dynamics of a component once, then adjust the
behaviours by using different parameters. For example, if we are building an
integrate-and-fire neuron, we can specify that the Reset-Voltage and the
Firing-Threshold are parameters, write our dynamics in terms of these
parameters, then use the *User Layer* to provide parameters to create different
neurons. Parameters are set at the start of the simulation, and remain constant
throughout.


Ports
~~~~~

Ports allow components to communicate between each other during a simulation. 
There are 2 types, *AnalogPorts* and *EventPorts*, and each can have
different modes.

AnalogPorts:
    AnalogPorts transmit and receive continuous values, `Alias` es and
    `StateVariables`. AnalogPorts can have 3 modes:

        * ``SendPort`` - transmit data originating in this component which can
           be read by other components
        * ``RecvPort`` - receive data from another components ``SendPort`` port.
            Each recv port can be connected to *one* ``SendPort``.

        * ``ReducePort`` - receive data from multiple ``SendPort`` . These
          differ from ``RecvPorts`` in that they can be connected to multiple
          ``SendPort`` . ``ReducePorts`` take an additional operator,
          ``operator``, which specifies how the data from multiple ``Send``
          ports should be combined to produce a single value. Currently, the
          only supported operations is `+`, which sums the inputs. The
          motivation for ``ReducePorts`` is that it allows us to make our
          component definitions more general. For example, if we are defining a
          neuron, would define a ``ReducePort`` called, ``InjectedCurrents``.
          This allows us to write the membrane equation for that neuron as:
            
          .. math::
            
            dV/dt = (1/C) * InjectedCurrents
          
          Then, when we connect this neuron to synapses, current-clamps, etc,
          we simply need to connect the SendPorts containing the currents of
          these components onto the ``InjectedCurrents`` reduce-port, within
          having to change our original component definitions.
        

EventPorts:
    Event ports transmit discrete events. They are useful for example in
    simulation of integrate-and-fire neurons to notify components about
    neuron's spiking. Event ports only have 2 modes:

        * ``SendPort`` - transmit events originating in this component which
          can be read by other components
        * ``RecvPort`` - receive events from another components ``SendPort``
          port. Each recv port can be connected to *multiple* ``SendPort``.

    For example, a synapse component may have a ``RecvPort`` connected to the
    presynaptic neurons ``SendPort`` port. When the presynaptic neuron fires;
    it delivers an event to the synapse, which could cause it to produce
    current flow in a post-synaptic neuron.
